          <h4>Stuck on a simple problem</h4>
          <h4>I aM n0t gud at speliNg and gramA</h4>
          <p>
            The problem was with the enterScores function in the gradebook challenge. Although the challenge itself wasn’t easy, where I went wrong should have been. “students” not “student”. Spelling is my most common issue when writing my code and It does well to make me feel stupid. I have learnt that I need to really comb over my code when getting errors.
          </p>

          <h4>Elegantly solving a problem</h4>
          <p>
            A problem I was really proud of myself for completing easily or elegantly was the SuperZizzBuzz challenge. I had done a variation of this challenge in the past  and I really struggled with it. I felt great to see how much my coding skills had already developed since starting last time.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
          <p>
            I find Pseudocode is very useful, but I am still working out the best way to break up the task. Sometimes the steps just come very clear and others it's hard to know how to write the first step and I just have to write some code for a start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Console.logging is one of my preferred techniques. I feel like I used to be scared of it. That it wouldn't give me the result I wanted. Whereas now I use it as a tool to show me where I'm not getting the results I wanted…
          </p>
          <p>
            Stackoverflow is a great tool for problem solving. If you have a problem then 99.9% chance somebody has had that problem before you!

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Reflecting on my problem solving is something I would like to work on. I'm trying to celebrate the times I overcome a challenge as well as pulling myself away from the problem when I get really stuck. Also I need to work on ASKING FOR HELP.. I'm no go at it and I know that with the challenges getting harder it will become a must!</p>
