          <h4>Ethical Decision</h4>
          <p>In my last job I was faced with a decision regarding taking a job promotion to become the team lead on the maintenance team I was currently a part of. The issue was that I already had plans to leave the company within the next 6-8 months. Taking the position would have meant; a pay rise, more authority, more interesting role and great experience for my career.
            The consequences for taking the position would be that the company would spend 3 months training/preparing me for the position and then would have to do the same thing 3 months later for someone else when I left.
            I chose not to take the position and encouraged my colleague/friend to apply for the position and gave my recommendation to the company to offer him the position.
            The consequences of not taking the position were that I was still on the same salary and stuck in the same mundane position.
            Ultimately it was my relationship that I had with my teammates that helped me to make the decision. Seeing my colleague succeed in getting the position and developing his career was worth the sacrifice. 
            </p>
          <h4>Cultural influence</h4>
          <p>I have two cultural backgrounds, Maori culture on my Mothers side, and a more traditional Christian culture on my Fathers side.  
            I think that the culture from my Mothers side has had more influence on my identity in the way I treat the people who are most important in my life. Keeping family and friends happy is very important to me. Another value of mine that I think of is forgiveness and the ability to move on from issues in life. 
            </p>
          <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
          <p>My limitations; When I am faced with a challenge whether in a learning or work environment, I find myself avoiding the chance to take on new challenges. Although my strength is that I am a fast learner and generally do well with challenges when I take them on.</p>
          <p>Being a fast learner is valuable to my learning journey as long as I overcome the fear of the initial challenge. During this course I will be faced with many situations where I will feel the fear to try something new and fail. I need to focus on my strengths to help me succeed.</p>

          <h4>Tension when working in a team</h4>
          <p>While working as part of a maintenance team we had a situation that caused tension. The issue was one of the team members not contributing or completing the tasks that they were assigned. As well as making consistent mistakes creating more work for the team.
            This created a situation where the rest of the team got frustrated and began talking about the colleague behind their back. I raised the issue to our team lead, so that he could deal with the issue before it got back to the team member in question. My team lead passed the issue on to management and the issue was later resolved when that team member left the company.
            I think the way this was handled was not right and we as a team were too slow to raise the issue. If we had raised it with our team lead and worked together to solve the issue then I believe we could have come to a conclusion where the team member didn't lose his job.
