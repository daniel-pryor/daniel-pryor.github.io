          <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>Oxford languages defines Emotional Intelligence as: the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
            The ability to understand not only your own emotions but others as well. Being aware and understanding these emotions can improve the way we interact with others and the relationships we have.
            </p>

          <h4>How is it different from IQ?</h4>
          <p>IQ is the measure of one's Intelligence using a standardized intelligence test. Comparing chronological age to mental age. The test measures topics such as knowledge of the world, fluid reasoning and memory test. 
            Emotional intelligence refers to one's ability to identify emotions, evaluate how others feel, control one's emotions and more.  IQ is said to be the hard skills, where EQ are the soft skills. IQ may be your ability to write code, while EQ is your ability to work well in a team.
            </p>

          <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
          <p>EQ is becoming more recognized as an important part of one's personal success in life. Whether career success or relationship success. This ability is recognised by some companies as more important than your technical skills. 
            Jesse Wright, VP of Recruiting and Delivery at Adecco Engineering and Technology said. “It’s really important to remember that when people hire someone, your hard skills get you to the table, but it’s your soft skills that get you the job — and it’s your soft skills that help you interact in a work environment.”

          <h4>My Experience</h4>
          <p>Honestly up until this year I think emotional intelligence was something I had little to no idea about. It is a subject that is slowly becoming more important in my life as a start to think more about the impact that I have or want to have on people in my life. I am only at the beginning of my journey into mindfulness and I look forward to seeing what comes out of it.</p>
