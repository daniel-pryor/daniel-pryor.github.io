          <h4>Long Term Goal</h4>
          <p>My long term goal is to work for myself in my own shared workshop/studio which combines design, tech and engineering in one place.  I have broken this goal down into 3 smaller goals:
            <li>Get a Developer Job</li> 
            <li>Become a Freelancer</li>
            <li>Start my own Workshop/Studio</li>
          </p>

          <h4>Strengths & Limitations</h4>
          <p>My strength when learning is that I am a fast learner, my limitation is that I find myself procrastinating when taking on a new challenge.</p>
          <p>I would like to grow my confidence when working with people I don't yet know. I tend to watch from the outside instead of speaking up and voicing my opinion and ideas.</p>

          <h4>Commitments</h4>
          <p>Since starting Foundations I have changed the way I study. I get up at 7am (when my partner goes to work), make a coffee and walk to the beach. This ritual has made me much more productive and helps me to plan what I have on for the day. 
          </p>
          <p>When things are building up I may have to do this ritual a couple more times throughout the day to keep my mind fresh.
          </p>
          <p>Asking for help - I will be trying to take note of how long I am spending when struggling with a task. It can be daunting to ask for help in the group chats, this is something I need to work on.</p>

          <p>It may sound sad but the only real commitment I have is to Dev Academy. I have a Tennis Club Night on Wednesdays which is my closest thing to another commitment. And of course surfing during my lunch break.</p>

          <h4>Expectations</h4>
          <p>Understanding is the key for me. Realising that we all learn differently and interpret things in different ways when learning.</p>
