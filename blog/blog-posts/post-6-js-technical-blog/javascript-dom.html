          <h4>What is Javascript and how does it relate to HTML & CSS?</h4>
          <p>Imagine its your friends birthday and you have decided you want to make them a cake. Think of HTML as the cake. But without icing, no flavours, no colours, just a cake. Boring huh. Your best guess is that your friend isn't going to be that stoked with a flavourless, colourless cake on their birthday. CSS is your flavour, colour and decorations. Add those and you've got a pretty good looking cake. But your friend is pretty fussy. You know that this still won't cut it. Here's where Javascipt(JS) comes to save the day(birthday). With a sprinkle of JS the cake is now singing happy birthday to your friend, when they blow out the candles, the candles relight themselves. You realise you got your friends age wrong on the cake and the cake has now corrected the age for you! Javascript does all the interactions!!</p>

          <h4>Control flow & Loops</h4>
          <p>Control flow is the order in which your computer executes the code/statements in your script or js file.
            The code will run in order from the first line to the last line unless told otherwise. And otherwise happens a lot. Statements such as Loops and Conditionals will change and control the flow. Think of it like you're getting ready to go to work. And you can't leave without having a coffee. You would use an <span><code>if else</code></span> statement. <span><code>if</code></span> you have had your coffee - go to work. <span><code>else</code></span> - stay home. </p>
            <p>Loops are similar, but you have the ability to run the code multiple times. Your shirt has 6 buttons on it. And you can't leave until 5 of them are done up. You would use a <span><code>for</code></span> loop. Using the for loop you would run the code such as - do up button - 5 times over.</p>
          <h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
          <button id="changeColor" onclick="changeColor()">Change colour</button>
          
          <p>Click the button above to see an example of the DOM in action. </p>
          <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>
          <h4>Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h4>
          <p>You access an array element by referring to the index number: <pre>const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            let car = cars[0];</pre>
            Note: Array indexes start with 0.

            [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.</p>
          <p>Accessing data from ojects is done etiher by using .dot notation or brackets []. 
            <pre>objectName.propertyName</pre>
            <pre>objectName["propertyName"]</pre>
          </p>

          <h4>Functions</h4>
          <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
