          <h4>Benefits of Understanding</h4>
          <p>Understanding neuroplasticity benefits people with their education, careers, as well as their day to day lives. Without knowing that your brain is malleable, then how do you know that you can influence it? I have always thought that my thoughts, my moods, and my ability to learn was just “part of who I am”. It's exciting to know that I have the power to influence my brain in positive or negative directions. </p>

          <h4>Engaging Neuroplasticity</h4>
          <p>I would like to introduce the habit of practice, practice, practice into my journey through Dev Academy. I currently have a habit of learning something and then just moving on to the next thing without really solidifying the previous subject. I need to create those “freeways in my brain”.</p>

          <h4>How to increase it?</h4>
          <p>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
            Learning new skills, changing a routine and practicing mindfulness are 3 ways of increasing neuroplasticity that stood out to me. I would like to add these into my daily routine.

          <h4>Having a Growth Mindset</h4>
          <p>The idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn. Through affirmation and believing in your ability to learn. This is relevant to Dev Academy especially for those of us who may be struggling with imposter syndrome. Believing that you have the same ability to learn as the other people is this course is very important.</p>

          <h4>What Surprised Me?</h4>
          <p>The research about learning the piano surprised me. I have always thought that imagining myself surfing or landing a trick skateboarding helped me to physically do the trick. But the figures in the “study” seem very high. I should start imagining more!</p>  

          <h4>Intergrating the Growth Mindset</h4>
          <p>Havign a growth mindset is going to be important when it comes to the harder challenges. It is easy to feel left behind or uninspired when reading the group chats on discord and seeing how far ahead some people are. It's important to remember that we all learn at our own pace and have the same end goal.</p>
