          <h4>Past</h4>
          <p>My journey in becoming a Web Developer started in 2020 while living in Berlin. Previously I had been working as an aircraft engineer and technician almost 6 years. Although I enjoy the practical side of engineering, I just didn't see myself having a future working for an airline. I reduced my working hours and began self studying online to become a Web Developer. November 2021 I moved back to New Zealand and decided it was time to add structure to my learning. I studied for one semester at Toi Ohomai before deciding that Dev Academy was where I needed to be. </p>
          <h4>Present</h4>
          <p>I live 2 minutes walk from the beach on Tay Street in Mount Maunganui. Studying at home can be lonely, but it gives me the freedom to drink my morning coffee at the beach and go surfing on my lunchbreak. With the support of my partner Johanna, Im super excited to be on this journey at Dev Academy. One week in and I think I can easliy say this has been one of the best decisions of my life.</p>
          <h4>Future</h4>
          <p>Completing Dev Academy is my first goal. Then of course getting a job and blah blah blah. My dream though is to create my own workspace to combine my new skills in developing as well as my skills in engineering. I don't know exactly how thats is going to work yet.. but it's the first time I have felt like I know what I want to do with my career. </p>
