          <h4>3 new things I learnt about my ego</h4>
          <p>
            First thing I learnt is that I didn't realise how much my ego controlled the way I felt during learning.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It's incredibly hard to remove your ego from the situation. Sometimes going into the group chat was a real hit to the ego when seeing how well some of my fellow students were able to solve the challenges. I always had to take a step back and remember that I am on my own journey and we all learn differently.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I learnt how much my ego interferes with my day to day life in a negative way. I really tried to embrace the thought of “wishing everyone well” inside my head even when passing someone on the street. And instead of judging - just noticing things. I found this really satisfying and removed my ego from the situation. 
          </p>

          <h4>Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming?</h4>
          <p>	
            I think the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming are especially important when the learning gets tough. I believe it is important to be aware of how you are feeling about your own learning and try not to compare with others. This is the same when trying to help someone that may be struggling on something that you may consider as easy. You need to have the ability to relate with the person and their struggle. 
          </p>

          <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            What surprised me the most was how much I ended up enjoying the topic. I hadn't thought so much about the mental toll that studying can take. Being introduced to the topic of mindfulness and integrating meditation into my study routine has definitely saved me a few hours of sleep over foundations.
          </p>

          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            For me writing blog posts was the most challenging. It's hard to get comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings with complete strangers. I am grateful that I have been put into that position to push myself into opening up.
          </p>

          <h4>Why so much focus on core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            I asked myself that question at the start of this course, and I had no answer. The more I have learnt about core learning, the more important it has become to me and the way I think about my own learning. Especially with a fast paced intensive learning environment. 
          </p>

          <h4>Is it a waste of time?</h4>
          <p>
            No not at all, I think the ratio was good. I would have liked to spend more of my own time focussing on core practices and learning about mindfulness techniques. What I did learn has already been really helpful in my study so far.
