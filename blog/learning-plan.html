        <h4>Long Term Goal</h4>
        <p>
          I have only recently come up with an idea of what I want to do with my skills after leaving Dev Academy. Initially I would like to get a job somewhere I can continue to grow my skills as a developer. In the long term I want to combine these new skills with my passion for design and creating things. I want to have a shared creative space for like-minded people who not only want to create things on a computer but also design and build products in a workshop.
        </p>

        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p>
          A new limitation I have found throughout foundations is that the more time I spend off the computer the harder it is for me to push myself to get back into the driver's seat. My self confidence is lacking greatly when it comes to starting the task at hand. I am looking forward to working with others for some added motivation.
        </p>

        <h4>Non-Technical Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be to speak up when part of a group of people that I don't know. I think it is great how some of the other students are so confident in the group chats etc. I'm still working on it.. Also maintaining my stress levels will be another big challenge. Meditation will be a necessity for me to take my mind off the task and rest.
        </p>

        <h4>Human-Skills</h4>
        <p>
          I would love to get better at receiving feedback. It is something that I definitely struggle with and I think that it is a really good quality to have. I can't help but get defensive. It is something that will help me not only in my career but also in my relationships.
        </p>

        <h4>Expectations of Staff</h4>
        <p>
          I only expect understanding from the bootcamp team. That we are all here trying to learn. The feeling I get from Dev Academy so far I think this is not going to be an issue.
        </p>

        <h4>Expectations of Myself</h4>
        <p>
          I think I struggle with setting expectations for myself. I would say mostly I set my expectations too high. But if I don't set any then I can easily feel lost without a purpose. I am still getting the hang of setting goals for myself. 
          My main expectations are that I try my hardest to become a part of the team environment and to learn as much as I can. I want to find structure in my learning so that I can make it more comfortable for myself and my pairs. Things like limiting alcohol will be essential for me to stay in the right mindset for studying. 
          I am lucky that I have no other commitments for the next 10 weeks and have the ability to fully focus my attention on bootcamp. I will be committing to getting up, taking my walk to the beach and coming back for morning meditation and be ready for the day at 8:45am. I am nervous but also looking forward to challenging myself technically and mentally.

          <h4>Long Term Goal</h4>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to work for myself in my own shared workshop/studio which combines design, tech and engineering in one place.  I have broken this goal down into 3 smaller goals:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Get a Developer Job</li> 
            <li>Become a Freelancer</li>
            <li>Start my own Workshop/Studio</li>
          </p>

          <h4>Strengths & Limitations</h4>
          <p>My strength when learning is that I am a fast learner, my limitation is that I find myself procrastinating when taking on a new challenge.</p>
          <p>I would like to grow my confidence when working with people I don't yet know. I tend to watch from the outside instead of speaking up and voicing my opinion and ideas.</p>

          <h4>Commitments</h4>
          <p>Since starting Foundations I have changed the way I study. I get up at 7am (when my partner goes to work), make a coffee and walk to the beach. This ritual has made me much more productive and helps me to plan what I have on for the day. 
          </p>
          <p>When things are building up I may have to do this ritual a couple more times throughout the day to keep my mind fresh.
          </p>
          <p>Asking for help - I will be trying to take note of how long I am spending when struggling with a task. It can be daunting to ask for help in the group chats, this is something I need to work on.</p>

          <p>It may sound sad but the only real commitment I have is to Dev Academy. I have a Tennis Club Night on Wednesdays which is my closest thing to another commitment. And of course surfing during my lunch break.</p>

          <h4>Expectations</h4>
          <p>Understanding is the key for me. Realising that we all learn differently and interpret things in different ways when learning.</p>
